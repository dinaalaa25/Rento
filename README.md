- [x] It uses at least one module from the Python Standard Library other than `random`  
  - **Modules used:** `json`, `os`, `re`  
- [x] It contains at least one class written by you that has both properties and methods. It uses `__init__()` to let the class initialize the object's attributes (note that `__init__()` doesn't count as a method). This includes instantiating the class and using the methods in your app.
  - **File name for the class definition:** `car.py`
  - **Line number(s) for the class definition:** Line 5
  - **Name of two properties:**
    - `brand`
    - `price_per_day`
  - **Name of two methods:**
    - `validate`
    - `save`
  - **File name and line numbers where the methods are used:**
    - `car_controller.py`:
      - `validate`: Line 86, Line 125 
      - `save`: Line 91, Line 130
- [x] It makes use of JavaScript in the front end and uses the localStorage of the web browser  
- [x] It uses modern JavaScript (`let`, `const`, arrow functions)  
- [x] It makes use of the reading and writing to the same JSON file  
- [x] It contains conditional statements

  - **Line number(s):** 18, 27, 178, 184
- [x] It lets the user enter a value in a text box at some point (add/update car, sign in/up).This value is received and processed by your back end
Python code.  
- [x] It doesn't generate any error message even if the user
enters a wrong input.  
- [x] It is styled using my own CSS  
- [x] The code follows the code and style conventions as
introduced in the course, is fully documented using comments
and doesn't contain unused or experimental code.
In particular, the code should not use `print()` or
`console.log()` for any information the app user should see.
Instead, all user feedback needs to be visible in the
browser.
